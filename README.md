# PyAutoActions


- HDR will be enabled and disabled automatically for added processes.


- ex: `When you start a Game HDR will turn on and when you close It will turn off.`
- Processes can be added via filedialog or manually by process name (case-Insensitive).
- Very low cpu usage.
- Runs In tray.
